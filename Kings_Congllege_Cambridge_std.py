"""
Implement the BitTorrent reference client, including 
rarest-first, reciprocation and optimistic unblocking

Rarest-first:
Reciprocation:
Optimistic unblocking: 

1. Re-announces itself to the tracker every 30 min
2. Initiates a connection to each peer it learns about 
3. Accepts all connection requests.
4. Sends a "have-piece" message to each neighbor whenever it obtains a new piece 
5. Tracks the availability by maintaining a count of its neighbors that have each piece 
6. Uses a rarest-first algo to decide which pieces to request 
7. Equal-split capacity

Steps each round: 
- Happens every 10 seconds 
- Or when an unblocked peer leaves the neighborhood

1. Order peers in decreasing order of the avg
download rate received from them during the 
last 20 seconds (breaking ties randomly)

2. Request a piece from the first m-1 (m = 4) peers in the list

3. Optimisticaly unblock an interested peer every 3 rounds, 
selected at random. Leave the peer unblocked for the next 
3 rounds. 

4. Difference in behavior at the beginning and the end 
*(is this necessary? Not sure. End of p.118)
